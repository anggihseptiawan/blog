					<p>I just went live and silently started working on the Project Ideas. Most of them came from my app-ideas repository which I am very grateful for creating a year ago. It comes in handy whenever you need an idea for an app/project.</p>
					<p>The people who were watching me had no idea yet of what I was about to do. I just kept gathering resources and writing them down in a README file.</p>
					<p>Also had to look up some designs for the projects. I'm probably the worst designer I know so... I couldn't rely on those "skills" (if you can call them that, lol).</p>
					<p>I used this amazing resource by my friend Ildi on UI Design Daily. Designs which you can use for any project you want, even commercial ones, without attribution. Pretty cool, eh? üòÅ</p>
					<p>The day after the stream I also uploaded the video to my YouTube Channel and so far this has been the greatest, fastest growing video I did. Even the YouTube algorithm picked it up, which was amazing!</p>
					<p>At the time I'm writing this the video has close to 40k views and over 4k people subscribed to my channel since I uploaded it! I'm very grateful for that!</p>
					<p>People seem to enjoy these kind of challenges so... I'm going to try some more! üòÅ</p>
					<p>Next up in line: 10 JavaScript Projects in 1 Hour. Mini-projects. 6 minute projects.</p>
					<p>Thank you for reading! I hope you find it inspiring and that you'll also try this challenge one day and you'll have as much fun as I did!

Happy Coding! üòá</p>
